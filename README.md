Sleep and Health analytics website

The goal of this project is to develop a wristband which tracks physical health and daily activity of the user. The device will employ a pulse oximeter and accelerometer to provide information about sleep quality, exercise, and cardiovascular health. The device will also provide alerts for sedentary activity, and for optimal waking times. Lastly, the device will transmit movement and cardiac information via bluetooth to an objective-c application which will analyze and store the data for use in long term data analytics.
